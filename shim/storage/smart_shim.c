/**
 * Emulates SMART capabilities on drives without SMART support
 *
 * WHY?!
 * When running under a hypervisor some emulated drives will lack SMART support, which is required for some tools to
 * operate properly. For example QEmu (e.g. in Proxmox) emulate some basic SMART support (see qemu/hw/ide/core.c), which
 * is enough. However, surprisingly popular VMWare products lack any SMART support whatsoever. This is the main reason
 * for this shim to exist.
 *
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS?
 * The SMART subsystem is rather simple yet contains a large amount of legacy. To understand what's going on here you
 * should first read the micron.com docs and then fill-in the details from the official ATA/ATAPI-6 spec (see
 * references). Overall the SMART has a few main parts:
 *   - live/snapshot readings (that's the table with values & thresholds you see in smartctl)
 *   - capabilities (static values which specify what a given drive can do, e.g. whether SMART is supported)
 *   - stored logs
 *   - API to execute tests
 *
 * All SMART actions are executed by the userspace, and thus delivered via ioctl call to a device. When the ioctl is
 * executed a shared buffer is passed which contains a header + space for saving response data. There are two
 * different ioctl commands used to execute SMART requests with several subcommands:
 *   - HDIO_DRIVE_CMD (ioctl, see handle_hdio_drive_cmd_ioctl() & Documentation/ioctl/hdio.txt)
 *     - ATA_CMD_ID_ATA (read capabilities of the drive, see handle_ata_cmd_identify())
 *       # we only hook it to indicate that SMART is supported & enabled even if the ATA disk don't REALLY support it
 *       # if the drive supports SMART this hook is a noop
 *       # for non ATA-complaint disks (e.g. VirtIO SCSI) we generate a full fake IDENTIFY data (populate_ata_id())
 *     - ATA_CMD_SMART (read data from SMART subsystem, see handle_ata_cmd_smart())
 *       # we hook it to emulate SMART data
 *       # if the drive supports SMART this hook is a noop
 *       - ATA_SMART_READ_VALUES (read all live values from the drive, see populate_ata_smart_values())
 *       - ATA_SMART_READ_THRESHOLDS (read thresholds from live data of the drive, see populate_ata_smart_thresholds())
 *       - ATA_SMART_ENABLE (ask drive to enable SMART, it shouldn't really be delivered but we respond with "OK")
 *       - WIN_FT_SMART_READ_LOG_SECTOR (use WIN_SMART interface to read stored logs, see populate_win_smart_log())
 *       - WIN_FT_SMART_IMMEDIATE_OFFLINE (use WIN_SMART iface to run SMART test, see populate_win_smart_exec_test())
 *
 *  - HDIO_DRIVE_TASK (ioctl, see handle_hdio_drive_task_ioctl() & Documentation/ioctl/hdio.txt)
 *    - WIN_CMD_SMART (use WIN_SMART to read data from SMART subsystem, see handle_ata_task_smart())
 *      # this command is used by smartctl (and probably others) to read a general OK/FAIL status of a drive
 *      # we respond with "OK" to all commands below
 *      - WIN_FT_SMART_STATUS
 *      - WIN_FT_SMART_AUTOSAVE
 *      - WIN_FT_SMART_AUTO_OFFLINE
 *
 * Note: Most of the commands are using the standard ATA/ATAPI interface, few are using (legacy?) WIN_SMART interface.
 *       While WIN_SMART can theoretically be used to read values etc no tool from this century will do that (they will
 *       use the ATA/ATAPI interface). This shim emulates WIN_SMART only when needed.
 *
 *
 * LIMITATIONS
 *   - Values are always static and the same for all drives
 *   - Power-on hours & other counters (e.g. start-stop count) are static
 *     - Ideally values should be calculated as hours from some date to ensure they increase
 *     - Start-stop counter (and others) can be derived from power-on hours using linear regression
 *
 *
 * SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS FOR IOCTL REPLACEMENT
 * This submodule has a rather unintuitive initialization sequence (it's multistage). It works in the following order:
 *   1. Checks if "sd" driver is loaded
 *      - if not loaded it verifies if it exists in the kernel and overrides sd_ioctl() [see 2.]
 *      - it SHOULD wait for the driver instead but due to current notifier limitations we can't do that
 *   2. Temporarily installs trampoline in sd_ioctl() [drivers/scsi/sd.c] to sd_ioctl_canary()
 *   3. Awaits any IOCTL from userspace
 *      - it simply waits until sd_ioctl_canary() is called
 *      - sd_ioctl_canary's only role is to install a fast and permanent shim of sd_ioctl() by replacing the ioctl
 *        routing in SCSI driver (see details in the comment for sd_ioctl_canary()) to point to sd_ioctl_smart_shim()
 *      - sd_ioctl() trampoline is removed
 *      - after installation it triggers sd_ioctl_smart_shim() to handle that IOCTL which canary captured
 *   4. sd_ioctl_smart_shim() is triggered for every ioctl to a /dev/sdX device coming from the userspace
 *      - it filters commands which are SMART-related (or at least what smartmontools uses as nobody uses anything else)
 *      - all non-SMART commands are forwarded as-is
 *      - SMART commands are forwarded to the drive if the drive supports SMART, if not a sensible values are faked

 * Awaits any SCSI ioctl() to override the ioctl handler in sd_fops.ioctl (drivers/scsi/sd.c)

 * will be any program attempting to do an ioctl() on /dev/sdX. Then it gets gendisk from block_device passed, which in
 * turn contains a pointer to the same-for-all sd_fops. Having this pointer lets us replace ->ioctl pointer to finally
 * shim the sd_ioctl() pathway. This is done to AVOID using override_symbol:call_overridden_symbol() which isn't really
 * that multi-thread safe and actually pretty slow. The last thing we want is slowing down IOCTLs on a storage system.
 * Using this strange routine above installs a fast IOCTL filter to e.g. respond to SMARTs.
 *
 * While this method isn't really clear other ones are even worse. To find sd_fops we need to get at least one
 * FULLY INITIALIZED gendisk, which is complicated. During sd_probe() the gendisk is only partially built (i.e. it lacks
 * sd_fops...). These other parts are populated in delayed/scheduled sd_probe_async(). So the number of permutations is
 * quite large, as we need to consider the following states of the system:
 *  - no driver loaded
 *  - driver loaded, no drives yet
 *  - driver loaded, 1 drive which is not initialized yet
 *  - driver loaded, >1 drive, one initialized and one not
 *  - driver loaded, 1 drive which is initialized
 *  - ...... you see the point?
 *
 *  This whole thing would be much easier if we could get scsi_disk structure, but it's a private one (and heavily
 *  modified with MY_ABC_HERE).
